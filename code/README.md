1 - Introduction
------------------

OpenMIC framework supports the development of multi-agent applications that provide some kind of intelligence and computing services to the end users. Agents are assumed to run mostly on mini-pc and operate autonomously, collaborating one with the other, but also organized centrally when necessary or possible.

Applications interact with OpenMIC through a well-defined API, future extensions may include also RESTful API or even command line interface.
